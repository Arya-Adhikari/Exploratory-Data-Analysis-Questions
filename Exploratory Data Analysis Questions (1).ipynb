    "Normalize Distributions: It helps reduce right skewness (positive skew) by compressing large values and stretching small values, making the data more symmetric.\n",
    "Stabilize Variance: Log transformation can stabilize the variance, particularly in data where variability increases with the magnitude of the values.\n",
    "Improve Model Performance: Many models perform better with normally distributed data, so log transformation can make data more suitable for such models.\n",
    "Highlight Relationships: It can help in revealing relationships between variables that may be less apparent in the raw data.\n",
    "Log transformation is a common technique to make highly skewed data more manageable and improve the quality of analysis."
